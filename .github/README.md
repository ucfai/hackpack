# The Hackpack, by [SIGAI@UCF](https://ucfsigai.github.io/)

Our vision of the Hackpack is to be a central hub of resources that anyone can use to get started in artificial intelligence, or that the more experienced can use to continue their learning.

## The Layout of the Hackpack

The Hackpack is divvied up into 5 sections.
1. [Novels](/novels.md)
1. [MOOCs](/moocs.md)
1. [Papers](/papers.md)
1. [Textbooks](/textbooks.md)
1. [Tutorials](/tutorials.md)

## What You'll Find Here
### Novels
The point of novels is that they're more receational in nature, compared to papers.
Novels offer less scientific perspectives which can help develop your intuition, that in turns helps foster new insights in practice and research.

### MOOCs
MOOCs (Massively Open, Online Courses) are online classes, some a free, others are non-free; ultimately, these are great starting points, as most of these courses aren't advanced in nature.

### Papers
Papers are typically the output of research. 
These are typically rather involved, in terms of your understanding. 
Although you can read these without any prior understanding, we'd suggest that you avoid that, as the terminology may function as a deterrant.

### Textbooks
Textbooks are what you expect, they come in two flavors, specific and general &ndash; the general textbooks are like most, where they cover an entire field; while specific textbooks cover a particular topic, sometimes to a great depth.

### Tutorials
Tutorials are blogs and YouTube channels.
Blogs are essentially a way to "keep up with the times" about the latest, sometimes popular, advancements in the field.
YouTube channels tend to be more informative, in terms of being a way to learn that isn't contained, like a MOOC; but some are vlogs.
